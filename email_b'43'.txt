Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Jane Street.

Suppose you are given a table of currency exchange rates, represented as a 2D
array. Determine whether there is a possible arbitrage: that is, whether there
is some sequence of trades you can make, starting with some amount A of any
currency, so that you can end up with some amount greater than A of that
currency.

There are no transaction costs and you can trade fractional quantities.
