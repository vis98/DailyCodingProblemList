Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This question was asked by Zillow.

You are given a 2-d matrix where each cell represents number of coins in that
cell. Assuming we start at matrix[0][0], and can only move right or down, find
the maximum number of coins you can collect by the bottom right corner.

For example, in this matrix

0 3 1 1
2 0 0 4
1 5 3 1


The most we can collect is 0 + 2 + 1 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 12 coins.
