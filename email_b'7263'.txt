Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by MIT.

Blackjack [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack] is a two player card game
whose rules are as follows:

 * The player and then the dealer are each given two cards.
 * The player can then "hit", or ask for arbitrarily many additional cards, so
   long as their total does not exceed 21.
 * The dealer must then hit if their total is 16 or lower, otherwise pass.
 * Finally, the two compare totals, and the one with the greatest sum not
   exceeding 21 is the winner.

For this problem, cards values are counted as follows: each card between 2 and 
10 counts as their face value, face cards count as 10, and aces count as 1.

Given perfect knowledge of the sequence of cards in the deck, implement a
blackjack solver that maximizes the player's score (that is, wins minus losses).
