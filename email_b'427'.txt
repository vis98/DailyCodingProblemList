Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Huffman coding is a method of encoding characters based on their frequency. Each
letter is assigned a variable-length binary string, such as 0101 or 111110,
where shorter lengths correspond to more common letters. To accomplish this, a
binary tree is built such that the path from the root to any leaf uniquely maps
to a character. When traversing the path, descending to a left child corresponds
to a 0 in the prefix, while descending right corresponds to 1.

Here is an example tree (note that only the leaf nodes have letters):

        *
      /   \
    *       *
   / \     / \
  *   a   t   *
 /             \
c               s


With this encoding, cats would be represented as 0000110111.

Given a dictionary of character frequencies, build a Huffman tree, and use it to
determine a mapping between characters and their encoded binary strings.
