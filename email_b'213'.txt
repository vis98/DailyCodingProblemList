Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Slack.

You are given an N by M matrix of 0s and 1s. Starting from the top left corner,
how many ways are there to reach the bottom right corner?

You can only move right and down. 0 represents an empty space while 1 represents
a wall you cannot walk through.

For example, given the following matrix:

[[0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 1],
 [1, 0, 0]]


Return two, as there are only two ways to get to the bottom right:

 * Right, down, down, right
 * Down, right, down, right

The top left corner and bottom right corner will always be 0.
