Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Google.

You are given an array of arrays of integers, where each array corresponds to a
row in a triangle of numbers. For example, [[1], [2, 3], [1, 5, 1]] represents
the triangle:

  1
 2 3
1 5 1


We define a path in the triangle to start at the top and go down one row at a
time to an adjacent value, eventually ending with an entry on the bottom row.
For example, 1 -> 3 -> 5. The weight of the path is the sum of the entries.

Write a program that returns the weight of the maximum weight path.
