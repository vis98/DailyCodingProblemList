Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Spotify.

You are the technical director of WSPT radio, serving listeners nationwide. For
simplicity's sake we can consider each listener to live along a horizontal line
stretching from 0 (west) to 1000 (east).

Given a list of N listeners, and a list of M radio towers, each placed at
various locations along this line, determine what the minimum broadcast range
would have to be in order for each listener's home to be covered.

For example, suppose listeners = [1, 5, 11, 20], and towers = [4, 8, 15]. In
this case the minimum range would be 5, since that would be required for the
tower at position 15 to reach the listener at position 20.
