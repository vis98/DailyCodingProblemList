Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Uber.

Implement a 2D iterator class. It will be initialized with an array of arrays,
and should implement the following methods:

 * next(): returns the next element in the array of arrays. If there are no more
   elements, raise an exception.
 * has_next(): returns whether or not the iterator still has elements left.

For example, given the input [[1, 2], [3], [], [4, 5, 6]], calling next() 
repeatedly should output 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

Do not use flatten or otherwise clone the arrays. Some of the arrays can be
empty.
