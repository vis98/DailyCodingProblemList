Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Mailchimp.

You are given an array representing the heights of neighboring buildings on a
city street, from east to west. The city assessor would like you to write an
algorithm that returns how many of these buildings have a view of the setting
sun, in order to properly value the street.

For example, given the array [3, 7, 8, 3, 6, 1], you should return 3, since the
top floors of the buildings with heights 8, 6, and 1 all have an unobstructed
view to the west.

Can you do this using just one forward pass through the array?
