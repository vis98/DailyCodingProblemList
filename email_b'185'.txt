Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Given a pivot x, and a list lst, partition the list into three parts.

 * The first part contains all elements in lst that are less than x
 * The second part contains all elements in lst that are equal to x
 * The third part contains all elements in lst that are larger than x

Ordering within a part can be arbitrary.

For example, given x = 10 and lst = [9, 12, 3, 5, 14, 10, 10], one partition may
be `[9, 3, 5, 10, 10, 12, 14].
