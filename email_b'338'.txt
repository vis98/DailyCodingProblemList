Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Bloomberg.

There are N prisoners standing in a circle, waiting to be executed. The
executions are carried out starting with the kth person, and removing every
successive kth person going clockwise until there is no one left.

Given N and k, write an algorithm to determine where a prisoner should stand in
order to be the last survivor.

For example, if N = 5 and k = 2, the order of executions would be [2, 4, 1, 5,
3], so you should return 3.

Bonus: Find an O(log N) solution if k = 2.
