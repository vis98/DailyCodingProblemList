Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Google.

Given an array of integers and a number k, where 1 <= k <= length of the array,
compute the maximum values of each subarray of length k.

For example, given array = [10, 5, 2, 7, 8, 7] and k = 3, we should get: [10, 7,
8, 8], since:

 * 10 = max(10, 5, 2)
 * 7 = max(5, 2, 7)
 * 8 = max(2, 7, 8)
 * 8 = max(7, 8, 7)

Do this in O(n) time and O(k) space. You can modify the input array in-place and
you do not need to store the results. You can simply print them out as you
compute them.
