Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Nvidia.

You are given a list of N points (x1, y1), (x2, y2), ..., (xN, yN) representing
a polygon. You can assume these points are given in order; that is, you can
construct the polygon by connecting point 1 to point 2, point 2 to point 3, and
so on, finally looping around to connect point N to point 1.

Determine if a new point p lies inside this polygon. (If p is on the boundary of
the polygon, you should return False).
