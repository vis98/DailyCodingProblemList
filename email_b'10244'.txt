Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Google.

You are given a starting state start, a list of transition probabilities for a
Markov chain, and a number of steps num_steps. Run the Markov chain starting
from start for num_steps and compute the number of times we visited each state.

For example, given the starting state a, number of steps 5000, and the following
transition probabilities:

[
  ('a', 'a', 0.9),
  ('a', 'b', 0.075),
  ('a', 'c', 0.025),
  ('b', 'a', 0.15),
  ('b', 'b', 0.8),
  ('b', 'c', 0.05),
  ('c', 'a', 0.25),
  ('c', 'b', 0.25),
  ('c', 'c', 0.5)
]


One instance of running this Markov chain might produce { 'a': 3012, 'b': 1656,
'c': 332 }.
