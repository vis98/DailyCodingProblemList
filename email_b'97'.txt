Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Palantir.

Given a number represented by a list of digits, find the next greater
permutation of a number, in terms of lexicographic ordering. If there is not
greater permutation possible, return the permutation with the lowest
value/ordering.

For example, the list [1,2,3] should return [1,3,2]. The list [1,3,2] should
return [2,1,3]. The list [3,2,1] should return [1,2,3].

Can you perform the operation without allocating extra memory (disregarding the
input memory)?
