Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Dropbox.

Given a string s and a list of words words, where each word is the same length,
find all starting indices of substrings in sthat is a concatenation of every
word in words exactly once.

For example, given s = "dogcatcatcodecatdog" and words = ["cat", "dog"], return
[0, 13], since "dogcat" starts at index 0 and "catdog" starts at index 13.

Given s = "barfoobazbitbyte" and words = ["dog", "cat"], return [] since there
are no substrings composed of "dog" and "cat" in s.

The order of the indices does not matter.
