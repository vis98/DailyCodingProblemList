Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Palantir.

In academia, the h-index is a metric used to calculate the impact of a
researcher's papers. It is calculated as follows:

A researcher has index h if at least h of her N papers have h citations each. If
there are multiple h satisfying this formula, the maximum is chosen.

For example, suppose N = 5, and the respective citations of each paper are [4,
3, 0, 1, 5]. Then the h-index would be 3, since the researcher has 3 papers with
at least 3 citations.

Given a list of paper citations of a researcher, calculate their h-index.
