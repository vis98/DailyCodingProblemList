Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Amazon.

You are given a list of data entries that represent entries and exits of groups
of people into a building. An entry looks like this:

{"timestamp": 1526579928, count: 3, "type": "enter"}

This means 3 people entered the building. An exit looks like this:

{"timestamp": 1526580382, count: 2, "type": "exit"}

This means that 2 people exited the building. timestamp is in Unix time
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time].

Find the busiest period in the building, that is, the time with the most people
in the building. Return it as a pair of (start, end) timestamps. You can assume
the building always starts off and ends up empty, i.e. with 0 people inside.
