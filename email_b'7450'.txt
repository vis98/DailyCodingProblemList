Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Zillow.

A ternary search tree is a trie-like data structure where each node may have up
to three children. Here is an example which represents the words code, cob, be, 
ax, war, and we.

       c
    /  |  \
   b   o   w
 / |   |   |
a  e   d   a
|    / |   | \ 
x   b  e   r  e  


The tree is structured according to the following rules:

 * left child nodes link to words lexicographically earlier than the parent
   prefix
 * right child nodes link to words lexicographically later than the parent
   prefix
 * middle child nodes continue the current word

For instance, since code is the first word inserted in the tree, and cob 
lexicographically precedes cod, cob is represented as a left child extending
from cod.

Implement insertion and search functions for a ternary search tree.
