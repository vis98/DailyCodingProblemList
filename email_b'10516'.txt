Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Walmart Labs.

There are M people sitting in a row of N seats, where M < N. Your task is to
redistribute people such that there are no gaps between any of them, while
keeping overall movement to a minimum.

For example, suppose you are faced with an input of [0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1],
where 0 represents an empty seat and 1 represents a person. In this case, one
solution would be to place the person on the right in the fourth seat. We can
consider the cost of a solution to be the sum of the absolute distance each
person must move, so that the cost here would be five.

Given an input such as the one above, return the lowest possible cost of moving
people to remove all gaps.
