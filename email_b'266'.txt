Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today.

This problem was asked by Affirm.

Given a array of numbers representing the stock prices of a company in
chronological order, write a function that calculates the maximum profit you
could have made from buying and selling that stock. You're also given a number 
fee that represents a transaction fee for each buy and sell transaction.

You must buy before you can sell the stock, but you can make as many
transactions as you like.

For example, given [1, 3, 2, 8, 4, 10] and fee = 2, you should return 9, since
you could buy the stock at 1 dollar, and sell at 8 dollars, and then buy it at 4
dollars and sell it at 10 dollars. Since we did two transactions, there is a 4
dollar fee, so we have 7 + 6 = 13 profit minus 4 dollars of fees.
